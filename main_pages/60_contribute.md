There are many ways to contribute to the Tomopedia website, and we encourage
everybody to do so. Most of Tomopedia's content is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown),
which makes it easy to edit content with any text processor.

Below is a list of possible ways of contributing, with some
guidelines on how to proceed.

#### Report errors
If you see an error on this website, or want to suggest something that can
be added by someone else, please open an issue on Tomopedia's github page [here](https://www.github.com/tomopedia/tomopedia.github.io/issues).

#### Edit files directly on GitHub
The easiest way to make small changes and additions to Tomopedia is to edit the
files directly on Tomopedia's [GitHub page](https://www.github.com/tomopedia/tomopedia.github.io/).
A tutorial on how to edit files on GitHub is provided [here](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/).
Note that someone with administrator access to Tomopedia has to accept the changes
before they will show up on the website.

#### Propose changes in pull request
For bigger changes, it is probably better to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
the Tomopedia [git repository](https://github.com/tomopedia/tomopedia.github.io),
make your changes, and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
Tomopedia runs on [GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),
and should not be difficult to edit. The main pages (those that show up in the menu)
are located in `main_pages/`, while specific pages about algorithms or software
packages are arranged by topic (e.g. TomoPy's page is located at `software/tomopy.md`).
